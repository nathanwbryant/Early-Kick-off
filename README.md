# Early-Kick-off

An accumulator bet is a bet with multiple matches, in this case deciding the result of a match all to happen, so whether one of the picks or all of them lose, the bet is a loser.

A common accumulator is one that is some number of Premier League matches on a Saturday. Usually the first match is at 12:30pm, a few at 3pm and one more evening match.

When a punter loses the accumulator on the ‘early kick-off’ it is often seem as a gamblers sin. Never back the early kick-off.

Is there a statistical bias to kick-off times? Do better teams play worse? Do worse team overperform? Or is this all an emotional response to losing before the rest of the matches kick-off?


## Rate of Winning	

For every match played, in the ‘early kick-off’ and otherwise with can see a slight bias in the early kick-off matches.

This data considers any match won by the team who had higher odds pre-match.

The previous chart included all matches where a team with lower odds won. Whether that be a difference of 0.01 or 10+.

Going forward we will consider only favourites that had pre-match odds of less than 2. The spirit of the myth is not about marginal favourites but generally the ‘big 6’ teams against non ‘big 6’ teams, that often have the early kick-off for TV and seem like a sure bet to boost the bet.

The ratio is slightly closer here, with a small bias in early kick-off matches still, but of course the rates are a lot lower.

We must consider that a bet will lose if the punter backs the favourite and a draw occurs also.

This data includes all matches that we’re lost by the odds on favourite as before, as well as in the event of a draw.


The odds on favourite is a team with odds of less than 2 (evens) to win the match. Odds of evens implies a 50% of happening, thus we are looking only at teams with implied odds of greater than 50%.

Here we can see a slightly more exaggerated bias towards the early kick-off, over 3% greater rate of odds-on favourites failing to win.

## Average Odds	

Up to now we have grouped all favourites and underdogs into those groups with equal value. This of course does not represent the truth, every matchup is unique. Luckily we already have those values in the form of the odds.

The pattern remains when we look at the average odds of the correct result given that the odds on favourite doesn’t win.

## xG

We can look deeper into the performance of these teams using xG (Expected goals). 

This is the accumulation of scores given to every shot a team takes, based on the likelihood it will result in a goal. For example, a penalty is given a score of 0.74 xG, as approximately 74% of spot kicks go in.

Higher xG doesn’t automatically equal winning and vice versa, but it is a good indicator of performance when looking at averages over large datasets.

Here we can see that the favourite, on average, far outscored the underdog despite this data including non that they won.

However, there seems to be a slight drop in performance in the early kick-off matches, while the underdogs were more consistent.

## Conclusion

We can see that there may be some truth behind the myth, that long term gamblers seem to be worse off when backing odds on favourites in the early kick-off. It would be smarter to stick to early kick-off teams matched slightly more evenly or not at all to maximise profits. However, when it comes to betting like this you can maximise profits by avoiding it altogether. If one aims to have fun and the prospect of losing before the majority of games begin, it would be best to avoid the early kick-off no matter what the odds.
